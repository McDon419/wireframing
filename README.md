# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a **visual blueprint or schematic layout** of a digital product such as a website, mobile application, or software interface. It serves as a guide to structure content, navigation, and functionality before moving on to detailed design and development.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframing plays a crucial role in the **User Experience (UX) design process** because it allows designers, developers, and stakeholders to collaborate and validate ideas early. Some key benefits include:

- **Clarity and Communication**  
  Wireframes provide a clear visual representation of layout and functionality, ensuring all stakeholders share the same understanding of the product.

- **Focus on User Experience**  
  By stripping away colors, images, and detailed styling, wireframes emphasize structure, usability, and user flow.

- **Early Feedback**  
  Wireframes enable quick iterations and adjustments before significant time and resources are invested in development.

- **Efficient Development**  
  A well-prepared wireframe acts as a blueprint for developers, reducing ambiguity and rework later in the project.
